=== OpenPS3FTP README v2.0 ===

.: Default Login Details :.
Username: root
Password: openbox

A "nopass" version is included for those who prefer to use anonymous login.

.: Description :.
OpenPS3FTP is a minimalistic open source File Transfer Protocol ("FTP") server 
by jjolano for the PlayStation 3. It was written using the PSL1GHT SDK found at 
http://psl1ght.com/ (git: http://github.com/HACKERCHANNEL/PSL1GHT).

.: License :.
This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3. The source 
code (along with source trees of previous versions) is available at the 
OpenPS3FTP git repository at github: https://github.com/jjolano/openps3ftp

.: General Usage Tutorial :.
Just a small tutorial on the basics.

Prerequisites:
- Custom Firmware (tested on 3.55, but should work for all)
- A network connection
- Optional: Internet access (for IP address retrieval)

Installation:
- Extract the pkg files from the archive and copy them into a USB drive
- Connect the USB drive to your console and select the pkg file under the
  "Install Package Files" menu (found under Game)

    Note:
    The pkg file that you select should correspond to the custom firmware you 
    are using. For example: if you have installed geohot's 3.55 jailbreak, use 
    the file "openps3ftp.geohot.pkg". If not, use "openps3ftp.pkg". Users of 
    CFW 3.55 kmeaw can use any pkg.

- OpenPS3FTP is now installed!

Usage:

    Note:
    If your console doesn't have internet access and you don't know it's IP 
    address, you should take note of the IP Address in 
    Settings > Network Settings > Settings and Connection Status List.

- Launch OpenPS3FTP (found under Network)
- Wait until you see text on the screen.
- Connect to your console using an FTP client (such as FileZilla) using the IP 
  address that is shown on the screen (or what you noted down if you don't have 
  internet access) with username: root and password: openbox.
- Now that you're connected, you can browse through and manipulate files on 
  your console as if it were a folder on your computer.
